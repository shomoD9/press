# Press Video Craft Primer

This project exists to honor the quality of the writing, not to compensate for it.  
The script is already strong. Visuals must elevate meaning with taste, precision, and confidence.

## What We Never Compromise On

1. Script Is The Center
Every visual decision must serve the argument, clarify meaning, or deepen emotional weight. If a visual move does not improve understanding, it does not belong.

2. Premium Restraint Over Flash
We do not use flashy transitions, noisy colors, or trend-driven motion. No “SaaS landing page” energy. No “PowerPoint” look. No "simple and shabb" animation. Motion must feel intentional, smooth, and authored.

3. Animation Is The Main Language
Most of the video should be crafted animation. Screenshots/clips are supporting material. Center-screen captions are occasional emphasis, not the dominant mode.

4. No Stock-Led Storytelling
Stock footage is not a core strategy. If used at all, it is rare and strictly functional. The visual identity must come from our own crafted animation system.

5. Visual Metaphors Must Be Intelligent
Metaphors are used when they sharpen the idea. Not every beat needs a metaphor, but every beat must have a visual representation that is semantically precise and aesthetically coherent.

6. Rich, Minimalistic, Thoughtful Frames
Minimal does not mean plain. We build richness through composition, rhythm, texture, depth, and typography—not clutter. Each frame should feel designed, not assembled.

7. Motion Must Feel Weighted And Human
Animation should have deliberate pacing, strong key poses, clean easing, and controlled acceleration/deceleration. No jitter, no arbitrary movement, no ornamental motion.

8. Beat-Level Craft Standard
Each beat is treated like a designed shot. It must have clear intent, a strong visual thesis, and a satisfying motion arc (setup, development, resolution).

9. Cohesion Across The Whole Film
Color, type, spacing, camera behavior, and motion style must remain consistent. Scenes can vary in expression, but never in quality standard.

10. Designer-Level Quality Bar
Output should feel as if a skilled motion designer authored it by hand. If a scene feels generic, rushed, or obvious, it is not done.

## Practical Composition Priority

Primary: Programmatic animation  
Secondary: Concrete visual inserts (screenshots, clips, gifs when needed)  
Tertiary: Center-screen captions for emphasis/conclusion moments

## Final Rule

If a visual choice is merely attractive but not meaningful, remove it.  
Beauty is required, but beauty must carry thought.
